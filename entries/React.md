# React 

React is a popular [JavaScript](/wiki/javascript) library used for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is now widely used by many developers and companies. 

React allows developers to build reusable UI components, which can be used to quickly create complex user interfaces. React uses a virtual DOM, which allows for efficient updates to the UI without requiring a full reload of the page. React also has a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries, which can be used to extend its functionality and simplify development.
