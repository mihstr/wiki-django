# JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers. It is a client-side scripting language, which means it runs within the user's web browser rather than on a remote server. 

JavaScript is used to add dynamic and interactive features to web pages, such as drop-down menus, image sliders, and form validation. It is often used in conjunction with [HTML](/wiki/html) and [CSS](/wiki/css) to create modern, responsive web pages.
